# Enter your name in this variable
name = ''
print('This is the homework #1 for {}'.format(name))

# Question 1
# Print the following sentence: Hello, I am Herbert the chatbot!


# Question 2
# Using the newline character, use ONE print statement to display the following text:
# Southern trees bear strange fruit,
# (Blood on the leaves and blood at the root)
# Black body swinging in the southern breeze,
# Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.


# Question 3
# Create a variable called "pi" and make it equal to 22 divided by 7

# Use the variable to print the following statement (substituting <> for your variable):
# A decent approximation for the infinite decimal PI is <THE VALUE OF "pi">


# Question 4
new_houses_oprah_gave_me = 2
# Oprah is once again in a good mood and gave you 2 new houses. Create a variable
# called total_houses_oprah_gave_me and set it to new_houses_oprah_gave_me
# plus 11 (yes, Oprah gave you 11 houses already. Favourite child?)

# Use total_houses_oprah_gave_me to print (substituting <> for your variable):
# Oprah loves me so much she gave me <THE VALUE OF "total_houses_oprah_gave_me"> houses!


#  Question 5
days_until_christmas = "168"
# A month has gone and we want to substract 30 days. The value is a string, so
# we cannot subtract 30 from it. In a new variable "remaining_days", convert the
# values of "days_until_christmas" into an integer (whole number) and subtract
# 30 from it


# Question 6
# Ask the user: "How many centimetres long is the side of your square?"
# Save the result in a variable called "side_length"

# Create a new variable called "area" that uses "side_length" to determine the
# area of the square.

# Let the user know the area of the square by printing (substituting <> for your variable):
# The area of your square is <THE VALUE OF "area">
